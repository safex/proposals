### New Network Software Proposal

September 2016

## Introduction
This document is presented to introduce a plan to consolidate exposure to third party risk for Safe Exchange Coin holders. It outlines some parameters and features needed with the intention to construct a network and transaction software that is persistent anonymous and distributed. 

A proposal on http://vote.safe.exchange that points to this outline will be active October 3, 2016 and request Safe Exchange Coin holders to vote "yes" if they should agree that third party risk should be reduced and development of backend software be produced by the Safe Exchange developer. 

If a vote of "no" is majority then the Safe Exchange developer will be required to exclusively build against the previously indicated third party network software.

Safe Exchange Coin holders will have until October 18, 2016 to submit their opinion. A majority of voters will indicate the outcome of the voting. 

For example: if 10% of Safe Exchange Coins are accounted for in the voting by October 18, 2016... and 51% of those holders voted "yes" then the proposal will pass. Abstaining from voting indicates no interest.


## Destination
The Safe Exchange Project intends to produce a client software that interfaces with a decentralized and anonymous persistent data delivery network. This network must maintain the anonymity of participants and also be able to store structured cryptographic payloads. The payloads stored within the data structure can include trade details of physical goods as well as digital cryptographic assets. 

Accomplishing this permits for a decentralized and secure trading exchange. People can in privacy conduct trade as well as other transactions such as cryptographically verifiable digital contracts that also preserve the identities of participants against unauthorized snooping. 

The Network that hosts this must reward developers who build client applications that cause transactions to happen on the network. 

A seed group ought to exist to put the network to use. 

Making a new contract with the network will cost a unit of the minable coin.

Transactions are anonymous as well as contract instances.

Revealing transactions should be allowed.

Block times should be prompt: less than 1 minute.

Users should be able to broadcast transactions over tor.

Proof of Work mining will be the mode of block production.

Safe Exchange Coin holders will be able to gain from the reward that developers are able to receive if they generate transactions for the network via client interfaces.

The Safe Exchange developer can make a system to account for Safe Exchange Coin holder addresses and reserve the rewards to those owners who can then redeem their reward from the new network.



## Flight Path
1. Organize logistics such as coin count and distribution rate of the block chain network.
2. Organize software development
3. Code the network
4. Document the network
5. Organize promotion
6. Launch the network (begin mining)
7. Maintain the network
8. Poll users for feature requests




## Origins 
The Safe Exchange project's goal is to build an anonymous decentralized contract market. Originally the community had selected a third party provider that claimed to be capable of supplying the distrubted infrastructure that could host any data that is persistent and has digital integrity including anonymity. The choice selection in the opinion of the Safe Exchange developer was a mistake. A reliable solution must be sought out.

Third party activities are completely unpredictable because users can not know what third parties intend to do and also can not know entirely the validity of information that is presented from the third parties. Additionally changes to the third party software can cause undesirable damage to the intentions of the Safe Exchange project. 

There are other ways to accomplish an anonymous decentralized contract market let's put our shot on goal.
